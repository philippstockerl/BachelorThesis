  abstract = {The most important research area in robotics is navigation algorithms. Robot path planning (RPP) is the process of choosing the best route for a mobile robot to take before it moves. Finding an ideal or nearly ideal path is referred to as ``path planning optimization.'' Finding the best solution values that satisfy a single or a number of objectives, such as the shortest, smoothest, and safest path, is the goal. The objective of this study is to present an overview of navigation strategies for mobile robots that utilize three classical approaches, namely: the roadmap approach (RM), cell decomposition (CD), and artificial potential fields (APF), in addition to eleven heuristic approaches, including the genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimization (ACO), artificial bee colony (ABC), gray wolf optimization (GWO), shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA), whale optimization algorithm (WOA), bacterial foraging optimization (BFO), firefly (FF) algorithm, cuckoo search (CS), and bat algorithm (BA), which may be used in various environmental situations. Multiple issues, including dynamic goals, static and dynamic environments, multiple robots, real-time simulation, kinematic analysis, and hybrid algorithms, are addressed in a different set of articles presented in this study. A discussion, as well as thorough tables and charts, will be presented at the end of this work to help readers understand what types of strategies for path planning are developed for use in a wide range of ecological contexts. Therefore, this work's main contribution is that it provides a broad view of robot path planning, which will make it easier for scientists to study the topic in the near future.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider a shortest path network interdiction problem with incomplete information and multiple levels of interdiction intensity. The evader knows the attacker's decision on the network arcs that have been interdicted. However, the extent of damage on each arc depends on the interdiction intensity and the amount of budget spent for interdiction. We consider two cases in which the evader has incomplete information about both the intensity of attack on the interdicted arcs and the additional cost imposed for traversing those arcs. In the first case, the evader's perception of this cost falls in an interval of uncertainty. In the second case, it is assumed that the evader estimates a relative frequency for each level of interdiction intensity. This gives rise to multiple uncertainty sets for the evader's estimates of the additional cost. To handle the uncertainty that arises in both cases, a robust optimization approach is employed to derive the mathematical formulation of underlying bilevel optimization problem. For each case, we first take the well-known duality-based approach to reformulate the problem as a single-level model. We show that this method does not always end up with an integer solution or fails in achieving a solution within the time limit. Therefore, we develop an alternative algorithm based on the decomposition approach. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the duality-based method to obtain the optimal solution. Last, a real case study is presented to show the applicability of the studied problem.},

  abstract = {This is one of the most important challenges in domains like robotics, AI, and video games: given some start point, there generally needs to be a minimum cost way found to reach a specified goal. Algorithms like A would not change the static conditions since they compute extremely efficiently when the environments are static. But for dynamic environments, with all the new challenges of moving obstacles and changing terrains besides others, do increase the complexity. We compare to a quite heuristically well-known A* against an incremental search algorithm which we call D-Lite. Our ability is to deal with dynamic environments ubiquitously. In simulation, we demonstrate how though A* is highly suited for static environments, D-Lite best competes in dynamic scenarios owing to its ability to incrementally adapt to changing conditions without calculating paths anew from scratch. This explains why real-time applications are perfect for optimum pathfinding. It also throws much light on how D-Lite in dynamic algorithms adapts to environments for optimum operations.},

We then develop the analytical and computational optimization tools to obtain robust solutions of an uncertain LP problem via solving the corresponding explicitly stated convex RC program.

When only the cost coefficients are subject to uncertainty and the problem is a 0 - 1 discrete optimization problem on n variables, then we solve the robust counterpart by solving at most n + 1 instances of the original problem. Thus, the robust counterpart of a polynomially solvable 0 - 1 discrete optimization problem remains polynomially solvable. In particular, robust matching, spanning tree, shortest path, matroid intersection, etc. are polynomially solvable. We also show that the robust counterpart of an NP -hard {$\alpha$}-approximable 0 - 1 discrete optimization problem, remains {$\alpha$}-approximable. Finally, we propose an algorithm for robust network flows that solves the robust counterpart by solving a polynomial number of nominal minimum cost flow problems in a modified network.},

  abstract = {A robust approach to solving linear optimization problems with uncertain data was proposed in the early 1970s and has recently been extensively studied and extended. Under this approach, we are willing to accept a suboptimal solution for the nominal values of the data in order to ensure that the solution remains feasible and near optimal when the data changes. A concern with such an approach is that it might be too conservative. In this paper, we propose an approach that attempts to make this trade-off more attractive; that is, we investigate ways to decrease what we call the price of robustness. In particular, we flexibly adjust the level of conservatism of the robust solutions in terms of probabilistic bounds of constraint violations. An attractive aspect of our method is that the new robust formulation is also a linear optimization problem. Thus we naturally extend our methods to discrete optimization problems in a tractable way. We report numerical results for a portfolio optimization problem, a knapsack problem, and a problem from the Net Lib library.},

  abstract = {Effective path planning is crucial for autonomous mobile robots navigating complex environments. The ``global--local'' coupled path planning algorithm exhibits superior global planning capabilities and local adaptability. However, these algorithms often fail to fully realize their potential due to low efficiency and excessive constraints. To address these issues, this study introduces a simpler and more effective integration strategy. Specifically, this paper proposes using a bi-layer map and a feasible domain strategy to organically combine the D*Lite algorithm with the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA). The bi-layer map effectively reduces the number of nodes in global planning, enhancing the efficiency of the D*Lite algorithm. The feasible domain strategy decreases constraints, allowing the local algorithm DWA to utilize its local planning capabilities fully. Moreover, the cost functions of both the D*Lite algorithm and DWA have been refined, enabling the fused algorithm to cope with more complex environments. This paper conducts simulation experiments across various settings and compares our method with A\_DWA, another ``global--local'' coupled approach, which combines A* and DWA. D\_DWA significantly outperforms A\_DWA in complex environments, despite a 7.43\% increase in path length. It reduces the traversal of risk areas by 71.95\%, accumulative risk by 80.34\%, global planning time by 26.98\%, and time cost by 35.61\%. Additionally, D\_DWA outperforms the A\_Q algorithm, a coupled approach validated in real-world environments, which combines A* and Q-learning, achieving reductions of 1.34\% in path length, 67.14\% in traversal risk area, 78.70\% in cumulative risk, 34.85\% in global planning time, and 37.63\% in total time cost. The results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm in complex scenarios.},

Contrary to its deterministic counterpart, the robust formulation allows for uncertain customer demands, and the objective is to determine a minimum cost delivery plan that is feasible for all demand realizations within a prespecified uncertainty set. A crucial step in our heuristic is to verify the robust feasibility of a candidate route. For generic uncertainty sets, this step requires the solution of a convex optimization problem, which becomes computationally prohibitive for large instances. We present two classes of uncertainty sets for which route feasibility can be established much more efficiently. Although we discuss our implementation in the context of the AMP framework, our techniques readily extend to other metaheuristics. Computational studies on standard literature benchmarks with up to 483 customers and 38 vehicles demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to quickly provide high-quality solutions. In the process, we obtain new best solutions for a total of 123 benchmark instances.},

In this study, we review two key aspects of path planning: environmental representation and path generation techniques. Common path planning techniques are analyzed, and their key limitations are highlighted. Finally, we review thirty-five highly cited publications to identify current trends in drone path planning research.

In the sampling phase, a new adaptive target deviation sampling mechanism is designed to alter the sampling angle during the planning process based on the obstacle configuration between the continuously iterated new node and the target point. In the RRT* extension phase, improvements are made to the attractive potential field (APF) algorithm, and an adaptive step size is devised to enhance environmental adaptability and guidance by integrating with the RRT* algorithm. Additionally, a collision detection function has been designed to preemptively eliminate a portion of obstacles, thereby reducing the number of iterations and enhancing the efficiency of the planning process. In the RRT* connection phase, a bidirectional search strategy is introduced to boost the planning speed of the RRT* algorithm. Simultaneously, path pruning is implemented to eliminate redundant nodes and optimize path quality. Finally, comparisons are made with the RRT*, Bi-RRT*, Bias-RRT*, Bias-P-RRT*, and Informed-RRT* algorithms in seven different environments, including comparative data and analysis, validating the feasibility and superiority of the new optimization algorithm. Through comparison, the new algorithm demonstrates significant improvements, it yields shorter and smoother path lengths compared to other algorithms. In seven environments, it maintains a 100\% success rate, reducing the required time by at least 40\%. Overall, it exhibits superior path quality, enhanced adaptability to varying environments, and ultra-high speed.},

Firstly, the neighboring node clip-off rule is defined to optimize the node expansion mode of the A* algorithm, and the obstacle coverage model is designed to dynamically adjust the heurizing function of the A* algorithm to improve the path search efficiency. Then, the Bresenham algorithm is adopted for collision detection and critical path nodes are extracted to significantly reduce the number of path turning points. Secondly, a new tracking index is proposed to optimize the evaluation function of the dynamic window method to make the local path fit the global path further. By detecting the dangerous distance, the dynamic adaptive method of evaluation function weight is designed to improve the fixed weight of the dynamic window method. Finally, the key turning point of optimizing the A* algorithm is taken as the temporary target point to improve the DWA algorithm, and the local part follows the global part, and the fusion of the two algorithms is realized. Simulation results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the efficiency and smoothness of mobile robot path planning, enhance the real-time obstacle avoidance and adaptive ability of unknown environments, and better meet the requirements of complex planning tasks.},

However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g., as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g., showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM{$\ast$} and RRT{$\ast$}, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.},

  abstract = {Typical path planning algorithms are good for static obstacles avoidance, but not for dynamic obstacles, so path planning of intelligent vehicles in uncharted regions is a fundamental and critical problem. This study suggests an improved D* Lite algorithm to address the issues of large corner, node redundancy and close to obstacles in the path planned by D* Lite algorithm. Firstly, in order to increase the safety of the path, the D* Lite algorithm sets the safety distance between the intelligent vehicle and obstacles. Then, the kinematic constraints of intelligent vehicles are introduced to increase the path search direction and avoid path corners exceeding the steering maneuverability of intelligent vehicles. Next, the path is optimized, and the optimization process of removing redundant points is employed to tackle the problem of curved search path and redundant nodes, and the path is smoothed by using third-order Bezier curve to generate a path with continuous curvature. Finally, the enhanced D* Lite algorithm is fused with the improved dynamic window approach to achieve real-time obstacle avoidance based on the global optimal path for moving obstacles. Simulation studies in static and dynamic contexts are used to demonstrate the usefulness of the revised D* Lite algorithm. The results show that compared with other path planning methods, the path generated by the proposed method has more safety and smoothness features, and improves the path quality. Therefore, the proposed algorithm has certain effectiveness and superiority in path planning problems in static and dynamic environments.},

The result is an approach that combines the benefits of anytime and incremental planners to provide efficient solutions to complex, dynamic search problems.

There is no one general algorithm that is capable of solving all variants of the shortest-path problem due to the space and time complexities associated with each algorithm.

However, simulator outputs often exhibit systematic bias, while ground-truth measurements are costly and scarce. We study a stochastic shortest-path problem in which a planner has access to abundant synthetic samples, limited real-world observations, and an edge-similarity structure capturing expected behavioral similarity across links. We model the simulator-to-reality discrepancy as an unknown, edge-specific bias that varies smoothly over the similarity graph, and estimate it using Laplacian-regularized least squares. This approach yields calibrated edge cost estimates even in data-scarce regimes. We establish finite-sample error bounds, translate estimation error into path-level suboptimality guarantees, and propose a computable, data-driven certificate that verifies near-optimality of a candidate route. For cold-start settings without initial real data, we develop a biasaware active learning algorithm that leverages the simulator and adaptively selects edges to measure until a prescribed accuracy is met. Numerical experiments on multiple road networks and traffic graphs further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.},

Second, we design an efficient and flexible data generator and produce eight new synthetic datasets as the default datasets for our benchmark. Lastly, we introduce a multi-level large language model (LLM)-based framework for API usability evaluation-the first of its kind in graph analytics benchmarks. We conduct comprehensive experimental evaluations on existing platforms (GraphX, PowerGraph, Flash, Grape, Pregel+, Ligra, and G-thinker).

This research considers a multi-trip truck-drone routing problem under uncertainty. Each truck is allowed to take multiple trips from the depot, while each drone is allowed to perform a single trip from the launch locations. Based on customer preferences, deliveries are grouped into deliveries by trucks to distribution centers and deliveries by drones from distribution centers to customers. A mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated to minimize the sum of the waiting times of all customers. To deal with uncertainty, a new two-stage clustering algorithm that uses multiple-kernel learning-based and single-kernel learning-based methods is introduced to construct uncertainty sets. In the case of column-wised uncertainty, a two-stage clustering with a dimensional separation algorithm is developed to avoid over-conservatism. A twostep solution method is provided for solving the proposed robust model to reduce the CPU time. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated on several test problems. The results indicate that the developed algorithms can effectively avoid over-conservatism, reduce variables and constraints of the data-driven robust counterpart model, and reduce the CPU time required to solve the problem.},

The integer model uses a number of 0--1 variables ranging from 2000 to 15,000 and gives optimum solutions in an average time of 60 seconds (for instances up to 60 clients). An interactive decision support system was also developed. The system was tested with a set of real instances and, in a worst-case scenario (up to 60 clients), the routes obtained ranged from a 7\% to 12\% reduction in the distance travelled and from a 9\% to 11\% reduction in operational costs.},

However, the conventional A* algorithm and the subsequent improved algorithms still have some limitations in terms of robustness and efficiency. These limitations include slow algorithm efficiency, weak robustness, and collisions when robots are traversing. In this paper, we propose an improved A*-based algorithm called EBHSA* algorithm. The EBHSA* algorithm introduces the expansion distance, bidirectional search, heuristic function optimization and smoothing into path planning. The expansion distance extends a certain distance from obstacles to improve path robustness by avoiding collisions. Bidirectional search is a strategy that searches for a path from the start node and from the goal node at the same time. Heuristic function optimization designs a new heuristic function to replace the traditional heuristic function. Smoothing improves path robustness by reducing the number of right-angle turns. Moreover, we carry out simulation tests with the EBHSA* algorithm, and the test results show that the EBHSA* algorithm has excellent performance in terms of robustness and efficiency.

  abstract = {Path planning plays an essential role in mobile robot navigation, and the A* algorithm is one of the best-known path planning algorithms. However, the traditional A* algorithm has some limitations, such as slow planning speed, close to obstacles. In this paper, we propose an improved A*-based algorithm, called the EBS-A* algorithm, that introduces expansion distance, bidirectional search, and smoothing into path planning. The expansion distance means keeping an extra space from obstacles to improve path reliability by avoiding collisions. Bidirectional search is a strategy searching path from the start node and the goal node simultaneously. Smoothing improves path robustness by reducing the number of rightangle turns. In addition, simulation tests for the EBS-A* algorithm are performed, and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by transferring it to a robot operating system (ROS). The experimental results show that compared with the traditional A* algorithm, the proposed algorithm improves the path planning efficiency by 278\% and reduces the number of critical nodes by 91.89\% and the number of right-angle turns by 100\%.},

  abstract = {Although several surveys on Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) solvers specifically designed to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) have been conducted, they did not cover the state-of-the-art (SOTA) NCO solvers emerged recently. More importantly, to establish a comprehensive and up-to-date taxonomy of NCO solvers, we systematically review relevant publications and preprints, categorizing them into four distinct types, namely Learning to Construct, Learning to Improve, Learning to Predict-Once, and Learning to Predict-Multiplicity solvers. Subsequently, we present the inadequacies of the SOTA solvers, including poor generalization, incapability to solve largescale VRPs, inability to address most types of VRP variants simultaneously, and difficulty in comparing these NCO solvers with the conventional Operations Research algorithms. Simultaneously, we discuss on-going efforts, identify open inadequacies, as well as propose promising and viable directions to overcome these inadequacies. Notably, existing efforts focus on only one or two of these inadequacies, with none attempting to address all of them concurrently. In addition, we compare the performance of representative NCO solvers from the Reinforcement, Supervised, and Unsupervised Learning paradigms across VRPs of varying scales. Finally, following the proposed taxonomy, we provide an accompanying web page as a live repository for NCO solvers. Through this survey and the live repository, we aim to foster further advancements in the NCO community.},

  abstract = {The shortest path (SP) problem in a network with nonnegative arc lengths can be solved easily by Dijkstra's labeling algorithm in polynomial time. In the case of significant uncertainty of the arc lengths, a robustness approach is more appropriate. In this paper, we study the SP problem under arc length uncertainties. A scenario approach is adopted to characterize uncertainties. Two robustness criteria are specified: the absolute robust criterion and the robust deviation criterion. We show that under both criteria the robust SP problem is NP-complete even for the much more restricted layered networks of width 2, and with only 2 scenarios. A pseudo-polynomial algorithm is devised to solve the robust SP problem in general networks under bounded number of scenarios. Also presented is a more effecient algorithm for layered networks. However, in the case of unlimited number of scenarios, we show that the robust SP problem is strongly NP-hard. A simple heuristic for finding a good robust shortest path is provided, and the worst case performance is analyzed.},

  abstract = {This research addresses the Vehicle Routing Problem with Cross-docking under Demand Uncertainty (VRPCD-DU) where a set of homogeneous vehicles is used to transport orders from the suppliers to the corresponding customers via a cross-dock. VRPCD-DU considers customer demand volumes as random variables and determines a minimum cost delivery plan that is feasible for all anticipated demand realizations. A robust optimization counterpart of a deterministic VRPCD formulation is derived where support for the demand is a polyhedral set. The robust formulation can only be used to solve small VRPCD-DU instances, and an effective adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm is proposed for solving large instances. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted on benchmark sets for both VRPCD and VRPCD-DU. The results show that the ALNS algorithm computes new best-known solutions of the VRPCD benchmark instances. Moreover, demand uncertainty is extensively analyzed by investigating managerial insights. The price of robustness (PoR) is compared by considering various budget sets and alternative partitioning methods for the customers (i.e., ``random" and ``clustered"). The findings imply that a higher probability of capacity constraints' violation is generally observed for the suppliers and that customer partitioning methods share similar PoR.},

  abstract = {Mobile robotics research is an emerging area since last three decades. The present research on mobile robotics addresses the problems which are mainly on path planning algorithm and optimization in static as well as dynamic environments. A detailed review has been made in the broad field of mobile robotic research especially focussing on the path planning strategy in various cluttered environments, their advantages and disadvantages of each of these strategies/methods have been highlighted. The path planning strategy of mobile robots can be categorised as Classical Methods and Heuristic Methods. Further subcategorized as (i) Analytical Methods, (ii) Enumerative Methods, (iii) Evolutionary Methods and (iv) Meta-Heuristic Methods. Each of these aforesaid methods has its own advantages and disadvantages. However, the main weakness arises from the fact that, analytical methods are too complex for intangible applications, whereas the enumerative methods are anxious by the extent of the search space. On the other hand, when search space is too large in path planning strategy, many evolutionary methods have been shown to be ineffective. To overcome these drawbacks, meta-heuristic methods have been fascinating considerably in this broad field of research. Many techniques are developed in path planning for mobile robot worldwide, however, the most commonly used techniques are presented here for further study.},

  abstract = {In the conventional robust optimization (RO) context, the uncertainty is regarded as residing in a predetermined and fixed uncertainty set. In many applications, however, uncertainties are affected by decisions, making the current RO framework inapplicable. This paper investigates a class of twostage RO problems that involve decision-dependent uncertainties. We introduce a class of polyhedral uncertainty sets whose righthand-side vector has a dependency on the here-and-now decisions and seek to derive the exact optimal wait-and-see decisions for the second-stage problem. A novel iterative algorithm based on the Benders dual decomposition is proposed where advanced optimality cuts and feasibility cuts are designed to incorporate the uncertainty-decision coupling. The computational tractability, robust feasibility and optimality, and convergence performance of the proposed algorithm are guaranteed with theoretical proof. Four motivating application examples that feature the decisiondependent uncertainties are provided. Finally, the proposed solution methodology is verified by conducting case studies on the pre-disaster highway investment problem.},

  abstract = {In the face of uncertainty in customer demand and dynamic traffic conditions, determining the optimal logistics distribution route under deterministic conditions becomes challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach by adopting Robust Optimization Models for Electric Vehicle Path Optimization. Our robust optimization model incorporates two uncertainty sets, namely the convex set and the box set, to tackle variations in demand and speed. By introducing deviation coefficients, we compare the objective function values of the robust optimization model with those of the deterministic model. This enables us to understand the trade-offs between robustness and optimality. To find solutions for various instance sizes, we apply an improved genetic algorithm to solve the constructed model efficiently. Our case study results demonstrate that while the optimal objective function value of the robust optimization model may be higher than that of the deterministic model, it ensures the feasibility of the path even amidst demand fluctuations and dynamic traffic conditions. Moreover, we analyze the economic returns of velocity and demand under both uncertainty sets with different data sizes, using the deviation coefficients. These discoveries provide valuable perspectives for pertinent departments, assisting them in rendering well-informed choices and attaining practical significance in real-world scenarios. To recapitulate, our study introduces an innovative methodology for addressing the challenges of optimizing electric vehicle routes in the face of unpredictable demand fluctuations and time-dependent speed variations. By demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed robust optimization model, we contribute to the advancement of logistics and transportation systems in a volatile and uncertain environment.},

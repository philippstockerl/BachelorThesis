\section*{ABSTRACT}
This thesis investigates minimum-cost path planning in spatio-temporal environments under uncertain edge costs.
Our testbed is mobile-robot routing on directed graphs, with edge costs generated from synthetic spatio-temporal random fields via geostatistical methods. 
We compare two complementary approaches: (i) robust combinatorial optimization models for shortest paths, and (ii) an incremental shortest path heuristic that adapts after costs change. 
We address uncertainty both ex-ante (before executing a path) and ex-post (after cost shifts).
We evaluate three options drawn from these two approaches and use the results to answer the research objectives and questions.
Our research shows that...

\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
\vspace{1cm}

  \paragraph{Problem Setting}
    Autonomous vehicle navigation admits a wide range of planning formulations, ranging from
    global route planning to local reactive control and hybrid approaches that combine multiple
    decision layers \cite{katona2024,abdulsaheb2023}.
    Depending on the application, planners optimize objectives such as travel time, energy
    consumption, risk exposure, or mission goals under kinematic, safety, and environmental
    constraints \cite{aitsaadi2022,gugan2023,zafar2018}.
    Despite this diversity, many planning algorithms share a common structural core: they
    evaluate feasible paths on graph-based representations under additive cost models.

    From a methodological perspective, these formulations can be viewed as instances of
    combinatorial optimization problems (COP) studied in operations research (OR).
    The shortest-path problem (SPP) provides the most elementary abstraction of this core and
    underlies a wide range of planning algorithms, including heuristic search, dynamic
    programming, and network flow formulations \cite{wu2025,goerigk2024,qin2023}.
    Even when planning problems extend beyond single-pair routing—for example, through timing
    constraints, risk measures, or vehicle dynamics—their algorithmic structure often still
    relies on modified shortest-path computations.

    \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
    \vspace{-0.6cm}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/PassauWeatherMapSensor.png}
    \caption{Spatial environmental data with sensor locations and inferred wind intensity
    over a two-dimensional domain.}
    \label{fig:weather-radar}
    \end{wrapfigure}

    In real-world navigation tasks, however, the nominal assumptions of the classical SPP no
    longer hold.
    Traversal costs vary across space and time and are only partially observable at planning
    time.
    In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications, for instance, costs depend on environmental
    conditions such as wind fields, which directly affect travel time and operational risk along
    flight segments \cite{roytvandghiasvand2024}.
    Forecasts and sensor data provide partial information, but future realizations remain
    uncertain and deviations from nominal predictions are unavoidable.
        \clearpage

    Figure~\ref{fig:weather-radar} shows how heterogeneous environmental information can be
    aggregated into spatial cost fields that serve as inputs to routing decisions.
    As costs evolve over time, the relative attractiveness of feasible paths changes rather than
    being blocked entirely \cite{azizi2024}, such that planning decisions based solely on nominal
    information may perform poorly or even fail.
    Figure~\ref{fig:spatio-temporal-routing-example} illustrates this effect by showing spatial
    cost realizations at two different time points over an identical graph structure.
    This motivates extensions of the classical shortest-path problem that explicitly account
    for uncertainty and temporal dynamics in traversal costs.

  \end{subfigure}\hfill
    \caption{Spatial cost realizations at two different time points over a fixed graph topology.}
    \label{fig:spatio-temporal-routing-example}
  \end{figure}

  Two dominant paradigms address shortest-path planning under such uncertainty by extending
  the classical model in fundamentally different ways:

  \textit{Robust optimization (RO)} addresses uncertainty \textit{ex ante} by selecting complete
  paths prior to execution and protecting them against adverse cost realizations within
  explicitly defined uncertainty sets.
  Robust combinatorial shortest-path formulations optimize the worst-case path cost over such
  sets and increasingly derive uncertainty sets from data rather than expert choice \cite{chassein2019,goerigk2025}.
  This approach adopts a global, strategic perspective on uncertainty and is particularly
  suited to planning problems in which route decisions must be fixed before execution and
  robust performance guarantees are required.
  Prominent application areas include vehicle routing problems (VRPs), where robustness is
  used to model application-specific uncertainty \cite{roytvandghiasvand2024,zhang2023,yu2023}.
  Further extensions incorporate time-dependent decision making at multiple planning levels
  \cite{goerigk2021,zhang2022} and address scalability challenges arising from large data sets
  \cite{wu2025}.
  Evaluation in this literature typically relies on scenario-based or bounded-deviation
  constructions to compare robustness across alternative formulations \cite{chassein2019}.
  These models provide the ex-ante reference solutions used for comparison in this work.

  \textit{Incremental search-based planning} addresses uncertainty \textit{ex post} by revealing
  cost information during execution and repairing paths locally as changes occur.
  These methods build on classical shortest-path and heuristic search principles, most notably
  Dijkstra’s algorithm \cite{dijkstra1959} and A* \cite{hart1968}, and extend them to dynamic
  environments through algorithms such as D* \cite{stentz1994}, LPA* \cite{koenig2004}, and
  D* Lite \cite{koenig2002}.
  By reusing previous search effort, incremental planners avoid full recomputation and enable
  efficient replanning when edge costs change \cite{bagad2024}.
  Recent research focuses on refining these foundations to improve replanning efficiency, path
  quality, and robustness under frequent cost updates, for example by incorporating safety
  margins, kinematic constraints, or adaptive heuristics
  \cite{wang2021,wang2022,he2024,li2024,xu2025}.
  As a result, incremental search produces globally consistent paths while emphasizing
  execution-time adaptivity in dynamic and partially known environments \cite{karur2021}.
  This paradigm is therefore particularly well suited to mobile robotic systems, where tight
  integration with onboard sensing and frequent environment updates is required.

  In essence, robust optimization emphasizes strategic, global path planning by selecting a
  complete route at planning time and protecting it against worst-case cost realizations,
  often assuming centralized computation and limited adaptivity during execution.
  Incremental search-based methods likewise aim to compute globally consistent paths, but rely
  on locally grounded exploration and adaptation, trading increased online computation for
  the ability to react to newly revealed cost information.
  As a result, incremental planners are particularly well suited to onboard execution in
  mobile robotic systems, where sensing and computation are tightly coupled.
  Although both paradigms address the same underlying routing task, they differ fundamentally
  in their information assumptions, degree of adaptivity, and evaluation criteria.

  \paragraph{Research Objective}
  The objective of this thesis is to develop and apply a controlled experimental framework
  that enables systematic comparisons between ex-ante robust planning and ex-post adaptive
  search under identical spatio-temporal uncertainty realizations. In addition, the thesis
  explores a hybrid planning approach in which robust optimization provides global, ex-ante
  guidance, while incremental search contributes local, ex-post adaptation during execution.
  Using this framework, we conduct a systematic experimental comparison of selected
  robust shortest-path formulations and an incremental replanning method under
  spatio-temporal cost uncertainty. Performance is evaluated with respect to solution
  quality, computational effort, and execution-time adaptivity in order to assess the
  practical implications of each paradigm for autonomous vehicle guidance.

  \paragraph{Motivation}
  A key motivation for this objective is that, despite extensive research in robust
  optimization and incremental search, there is little controlled, head-to-head comparison
  of these approaches under shared experimental conditions. Robust shortest-path
  formulations and incremental search methods are typically studied in isolation and rarely
  evaluated on identical graph structures, common spatio-temporal cost realizations, and
  comparable performance metrics. This lack of a unified experimental setting limits our
  understanding of their relative strengths, weaknesses, and practical trade-offs for
  autonomous vehicle guidance on the same underlying cost fields.

  Related work exists in global--local planning frameworks that combine long-horizon
  planning with local reactive control \cite{gao2024,lu2025}. These methods typically
  decompose planning into a hierarchical structure, where a global planner computes a
  reference path and a local controller handles short-term disturbances and obstacle
  avoidance. While effective in practice, such approaches primarily focus on architectural
  integration and performance improvements within a single paradigm. Consequently,
  they do not provide a controlled comparison between ex-ante robustness and ex-post
  adaptivity under a common problem formulation, uncertainty model, and evaluation
  protocol.



  \paragraph{Contribution}
  The contributions of this thesis are fourfold:
  (i) the design of a reproducible experimental framework that enforces shared data,
  graph structures, and evaluation metrics across planning algorithms;
  (ii) a spatio-temporal cost generation process based on geostatistical random fields that
  are mapped consistently onto routing graphs;
  (iii) implementations of robust and incremental planning methods, including a hybrid
  guidance variant that combines ex-ante protection with ex-post adaptation; and
  (iv) a unified evaluation protocol for comparing solution cost, computational effort,
  and execution-time adaptivity.
  The experimental framework is implemented as a conceptual decision support system (DSS)
  that integrates spatio-temporal cost generation, robust combinatorial optimization models,
  and incremental search-based planning methods into a unified pipeline
  (Figure~\ref{fig:topdown-architecture-DSS}).

\chapter{CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS}
\label{chap:conceptual-foundations}
\section{Model and Data Driven \newline Decision Support Systems}
Decision Support Systems (DSS) are interactive, computer-based systems that support
decision-making in complex and uncertain environments by integrating data, analytical
models in user interfaces \cite{fernando2022}. Rather than automating decisions, DSS structure
decision-making by making assumptions explicit and enabling systematic comparison of
alternatives.

At a functional level, DSS link data with analytical models. Input data are processed and
transformed before being evaluated by models that represent the underlying decision
problem. The resulting outputs---such as costs, feasibility indicators, or performance
measures---are interpreted through visualization and interaction, forming the basis for
model-driven decision support \cite{power2002}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figs/BasicDSSArchitectureNew.png}
  \caption{Basic architecture of a model-driven decision support system}
  \label{fig:basic-dss-architecture}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{DSS for Vehicle Routing}
Vehicle routing constitutes a prominent application area for decision support systems \cite{ruiz2004,lacomme2021}.
Routing decisions require selecting efficient paths while accounting for operational
constraints, uncertain travel times, and dynamic environmental conditions. As a result,
vehicle routing DSS naturally integrate multiple analytical components.

A central role is played by model-driven DSS \cite{power2007}, which rely on formal models to represent
routing decisions and evaluate alternatives. Such systems may incorporate deterministic
optimization models, robust optimization models \cite{gounaris2016}, heuristic algorithms, or simulation-based
approaches \cite{fanti2015}. Decision variables typically correspond to route choices or planning
parameters, while performance measures include total cost, robustness, or computational
effort. Environmental conditions act as exogenous inputs that influence outcomes but
cannot be directly controlled.

Vehicle routing DSS often exhibit a strong data-driven component. When routing decisions
depend on geographic or spatial information, this leads naturally to spatial DSS \cite{keenan1998}, which
integrate geographic representations such as maps or spatial cost fields. These
representations enable decision makers to interpret routing decisions in their geographic
context and to relate analytical results to real-world environments \cite{ulmer2017}. In this thesis,
spatial DSS concepts are combined with model-driven DSS to address routing problems under
spatio-temporal uncertainty.

\paragraph{Model and Data Utilization}
The effectiveness of a DSS depends critically on the models and data it employs. Data
quality, aggregation, and normalization directly influence the reliability of
decision-relevant information, while the choice of analytical models determines which
aspects of the decision problem can be analyzed and optimized.
We employ a conceptual DSS for our autonomous vehicle routing problem as an interactive control surface
that embeds a data component and model components.

\section{Data Component: \newline Geostatistical Data Generation}
For the data component of our conceptual framework, we generate spatio-temporally correlated cost fields using geostatistical methods. These fields serve as controlled, reproducible inputs to all shortest-path models evaluated in this work. Since geostatistics is used purely as a data generation tool, we focus on implementation-relevant design choices rather than a detailed statistical treatment.

Using simulated data for model comparison is common practice when real-world data is scarce or difficult to control experimentally \cite{matsypura2026,meng2025}. Geostatistical frameworks provide a principled way to generate spatially and temporally correlated synthetic data while maintaining full control over variance, correlation length, and anisotropy \cite{muller2022}. In particular, we rely on the GSTools library, which offers reproducible implementations of second-order random field models widely used in simulation studies \cite{raimbault2019}.

We model cost fields as realizations of a weakly stationary Gaussian random field defined on a three-dimensional space–time domain. Spatial and temporal dependence are introduced via a parametric covariance function, whose structure is fully determined by a normalized correlation kernel and a metric distance. Time is treated as an additional geometric dimension, resulting in temporally consistent spatial slices rather than independent scenarios.

GSTools provides a family of admissible correlation kernels with varying smoothness and compact support properties (see Table~\ref{tab:gstools-covariance-models}). While kernel choice influences local regularity, all kernels share a common structure in which dependence is governed by a single scalar distance. Directional anisotropy and spatio-temporal coupling are incorporated by defining this distance through a weighted metric.

Figure~\ref{fig:two-by-four-kernels} illustrates the qualitative effect of different kernel choices under identical parameters. These visualizations demonstrate that kernel selection alone can induce substantially different spatial roughness, despite identical variance and correlation length. We further discuss kernel selection in Chapter~4.

The resulting spatio-temporal random fields constitute the data-generating basis for all experiments. Each temporal slice represents a spatial cost realization, and temporal correlation ensures consistency across scenarios. By discretizing spatial slices into directed graphs, the continuous geostatistical model is transformed into time-indexed shortest-path instances, enabling a controlled comparison of robust and adaptive planning methods under identical uncertainty assumptions

\section{Model Component: \newline Shortest-Path Planning Under Uncertainty}
\label{sec:shortest-path-planning-under-uncertainty}
This section establishes a common problem formulation for shortest-path planning that
serves as a conceptual foundation for the two planning paradigms studied in this thesis.
It serves as a backbone for the model component of our conceptual DSS.
We begin with the classical shortest-path problem under nominal assumptions and then
introduce cost uncertainty, highlighting how violations of these assumptions lead to
fundamentally different planning logics.

Although both paradigms address the same underlying routing problem on an identical graph
structure, they differ in how this problem is represented and solved.
Following the taxonomy of Hart et al.~\cite{hart1968}, we distinguish between
optimization-based formulations and heuristic search--based methods as two complementary
perspectives on shortest-path planning.
This distinction provides the organizing lens for the remainder of this chapter.

\paragraph{Shortest-path problem formulation}
We consider a directed graph $G=(V,A)$, where $V$ denotes the set of vertices and
$A \subseteq V \times V$ the set of directed arcs.
Each arc $e=(i,j)\in A$ is associated with a nonnegative traversal cost $c_e$.
A path $P$ from a start vertex $s\in V$ to a destination vertex $t\in V$ is defined
as an ordered sequence of arcs connecting $s$ to $t$.
The single-pair shortest-path problem (SPSP) consists of finding a path
$P^\star$ that minimizes the total path cost
\[
C(P) = \sum_{e \in P} c_e .
\]
Such graph structures naturally represent spatial or spatio-temporal cost fields derived
from simulated or real-world data (Figures~\ref{fig:weather-radar} and
\ref{fig:spatio-temporal-routing-example}).
The shortest-path problem is inherently combinatorial, as it requires selecting a feasible
sequence of discrete arcs from a finite set.

\paragraph{Nominal shortest-path problem}
In the classical (nominal) setting, traversal costs are assumed to be nonnegative,
time-invariant, and fully known at planning time.
Under these assumptions, both optimization-based and heuristic search--based approaches
solve the same underlying combinatorial problem and are equivalent with respect to
optimality, differing only in representation and solution strategy.

\vspace{0.2cm}
From an \emph{optimization perspective}, the shortest-path problem is treated as a combinatorial
optimization problem in which arcs constitute the ground set of decision elements.
Following the general framework of combinatorial optimization~\cite{goerigk2024}, let
$S = A$ denote the finite ground set of directed arcs.
Each arc $e \in A$ is associated with a nonnegative cost $c_e$, and a feasible solution
corresponds to selecting a subset of arcs that forms an $s$--$t$ path.
Using binary decision variables $x_e \in \{0,1\}$ to signal wether a edge is selected or not,
the nominal shortest-path problem can be formulated as

      \vspace{0.4cm}
      \begin{mdframed}[
        linewidth=0.8pt,
        roundcorner=5pt,
        innerleftmargin=10pt,
        innerrightmargin=10pt,
        innertopmargin=10pt,
        innerbottommargin=10pt
      ]
      \textbf{Nominal Combinatorial Shortest-Path Problem}
      \begin{empheq}{align}
      \min \quad & \sum_{e \in A} c_e x_e \\
      \text{s.t.} \quad
      & \sum_{(i,j)\in A} x_{ij} - \sum_{(j,i)\in A} x_{ji} = b_i
      && \forall i \in V, \\
      & x_e \in \{0,1\}
      && \forall e \in A,
      \label{eq:nominal-combinatorial-shortest-path}
      \end{empheq}
      \end{mdframed}
where $b_s = 1$, $b_t = -1$, and $b_i = 0$ for all
$i \in V \setminus \{s,t\}$.
The flow-balance constraints (2.2) define the feasible set
$\mathcal{X} \subseteq \{0,1\}^{|A|}$ and encode the combinatorial structure of valid
$s$--$t$ paths.
Under nonnegative costs, any optimal solution corresponds to a simple path.

\vspace{0.2cm}
\emph{Heuristic search--based methods} provide an algorithmic counterpart to this formulation.
They interpret the graph as a discrete state space in which vertices represent states and
arcs represent transitions.
Paths are constructed implicitly through successive state expansions guided by cost
estimates and heuristic information, rather than by explicitly selecting edges.
The nominal shortest-path problem can equivalently be expressed as a discrete dynamic
programming problem.
Let $V^\star(v)$ denote the optimal cost-to-go from node $v$ to the destination $t$.
Under deterministic, time-invariant, and fully known arc costs, $V^\star$ satisfies
Bellman’s optimality equation

      \vspace{0.4cm}
      \begin{mdframed}[
        linewidth=0.8pt,
        roundcorner=5pt,
        innerleftmargin=10pt,
        innerrightmargin=10pt,
        innertopmargin=10pt,
        innerbottommargin=10pt
      ]
      \textbf{Bellman’s Optimality Equation}
      \begin{empheq}{align}
      V^\star(t) = 0, \qquad
      V^\star(v) = \min_{(v,u)\in A} \left\{ c_{vu} + V^\star(u) \right\}
      \quad \forall v \in V \setminus \{t\}.
      \end{empheq}
      \end{mdframed}
This recursion formalizes optimal substructure: every subpath of an optimal path is itself
optimal.
Heuristic search algorithms such as A* exploit this structure by constructing the optimal
path implicitly.
A* maintains cost-to-come estimates $g(v)$ and expands nodes in increasing order of
\[
f(v) = g(v) + h(v),
\]
where $h(v)$ is an admissible and consistent heuristic estimate of the remaining cost from
$v$ to $t$.
With an admissible, consistent heuristic, A* returns an optimal $s$--$t$ path.
Thus, under nominal assumptions, optimization-based formulations and heuristic search
methods solve the same combinatorial shortest-path problem and are equivalent with respect
to optimality. A* serves as the nominal baseline; incremental methods such as LPA* and
D* Lite reuse its heuristic structure and repair only affected nodes when edge costs
change, rather than replanning from scratch (Table~\ref{tab:differences}).

\paragraph{Shortest-path planning under uncertainty}
In spatio-temporal routing environments, the nominal assumptions of time-invariant costs
and full information no longer hold.
We model uncertainty through time-varying traversal costs on a fixed graph.
Let $k \in \{1,\dots,T\}$ index discrete planning or execution steps, and let $c_e^k$ denote
the cost of arc $e$ at step $k$.
The cost vector $c^k = (c_e^k)_{e \in A}$ represents a realization of a
spatio-temporally correlated cost field.
Conditional on a realization, costs remain deterministic and nonnegative, but future
realizations are not known at planning time.
At the time a path is planned, only partial information about future cost realizations is
available, for example in the form of forecasts, bounds, or scenario samples.
Additional cost information may become available during execution.
Figure~\ref{fig:sp-under-uncertainty} illustrates how this uncertainty alters the decision
context relative to the nominal setting.
Uncertainty fundamentally affects the information structure and objective of the planning
problem.



See \cite{madkour2017,deo1984} for additional SPP taxonomy.
While each realized instance of the shortest-path problem satisfies Bellman’s optimality
principle individually, robust objectives may couple decisions across time or scenarios.
As a result, global optimal substructure need not hold with respect to the robust planning
objective, even though the underlying graph structure is unchanged.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figs/ShortestPathUnderUncertainty.png}
\caption{Conceptual overview of the shortest-path problem under uncertainty.
The underlying graph structure remains fixed, while traversal costs evolve over time.
Robust combinatorial optimization and incremental search-based planning represent two
distinct responses to uncertainty within the same problem setting.}
\label{fig:sp-under-uncertainty}
\end{figure}

Two coherent planning paradigms emerge from this setting.
Ex-ante robust optimization selects paths before execution and protects them against
adverse cost realizations within prescribed uncertainty sets.
Ex-post incremental search-based planning, in contrast, interleaves planning and execution
by repairing paths locally as new cost information becomes available.


The following sections formalize these two paradigms in detail.
Section~\ref{sec:robust-combinatorial-optimization} introduces robust combinatorial
shortest-path models under ex-ante uncertainty, while
Section~\ref{sec:incremental-search-based-path-planning} presents incremental
search-based planning as an ex-post adaptive alternative.

\section{Robust Combinatorial Optimization}
  \label{sec:robust-combinatorial-optimization}
  Building on the nominal formulation in Section~\ref{sec:shortest-path-planning-under-uncertainty} for the
  shortest-path problem (Equation~\ref{eq:nominal-combinatorial-shortest-path}),
  robust optimization replaces fixed costs $c$ with an uncertainty set $\mathcal{U}$ and
  seeks a path $x \in \mathcal{X}$ that minimizes the worst-case cost over $\mathcal{U}$.
  We refer to \cite{goerigk2024} for this section.

    \paragraph{Robust Optimization and the Min--Max Principle}
      In robust shortest-path planning, edge costs are not assumed to be known exactly at
      planning time.
      Instead, costs are assumed to belong to a prescribed uncertainty set
      $\mathcal{U}\subseteq\mathbb{R}_{\ge0}^{|E|}$.
      The planner selects a feasible path, while the adversary selects a cost realization
      from $\mathcal{U}$ that maximizes the cost of that path.

      Formally, robust planning is based on the min--max criterion
      \[
      \min_{x\in\mathcal{X}} \; \max_{\mathbf{c}\in\mathcal{U}}
      \sum_{(i,j)\in E} c_{ij} x_{ij},
      \]
      where $\mathcal{X}$ denotes the set of feasible $s$--$t$ paths defined by the
      flow-balance constraints.
      This criterion guarantees worst-case protection against all cost realizations
      contained in $\mathcal{U}$.
      Alternative robustness concepts exist, but the min--max formulation provides the
      strongest feasibility guarantees and is therefore adopted throughout this thesis.

      The choice of the uncertainty set $\mathcal{U}$ determines the level of conservatism
      and the computational structure of the resulting model.
      In the following paragraphs, we introduce the uncertainty models used in this thesis.
      Their integration into fully specified shortest-path formulations is deferred to the
      Methodology chapter, where implementation details are discussed.


    \paragraph{Uncertainty Sets}
      The uncertainty set $\mathcal{U}$ specifies which realizations of edge costs are
      considered plausible and directly determines the level of robustness and
      conservatism of the resulting solution.
      In the context of shortest-path planning, each component of a cost vector
      corresponds to a single directed edge of the underlying graph.

  \end{subfigure}

  \caption{Geometric interpretation of uncertainty sets in cost space.  
  Left: discrete uncertainty represented by a finite set of scenario realizations.  
  Right: continuous budgeted uncertainty defined by nominal costs and bounded deviations
  under a global uncertainty budget $\Gamma$.}
  \label{fig:uncertainty-sets}
\end{figure}

      In this thesis, uncertainty sets are not inferred from observational data, but
      constructed deliberately from synthetic spatio-temporal random fields to enable
      controlled experimentation.
      Edge costs are generated as a three-dimensional array indexed over space and
      time, where each two-dimensional slice corresponds to a spatial cost realization
      at a given time step.
      Based on this representation, two complementary uncertainty models are derived
      and evaluated: discrete scenario-based uncertainty and continuous budgeted
      uncertainty.
      Figure~\ref{fig:uncertainty-sets} provides a geometric illustration of the two uncertainty
models considered in this thesis.


    \paragraph{Discrete Uncertainty Sets}
      A discrete uncertainty set consists of a finite collection of cost scenarios
      \[
      \mathcal{U} = \{\mathbf{c}^1, \dots, \mathbf{c}^K\},
      \]
      where each vector $\mathbf{c}^k$ represents a complete realization of edge costs
      over the graph.
      As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:discrete-uncertainty-set}, discrete uncertainty models
represent uncertainty through a finite set of cost vectors, each corresponding to a
complete scenario realization.

      In the experimental setup of this thesis, discrete uncertainty arises naturally
      from the spatio-temporal random field representation.
      Each cost vector $\mathbf{c}^k$ corresponds to a single two-dimensional time slice
      of the three-dimensional spatio-temporal random field array.
      That is, all edge costs within one scenario are taken from the same temporal
      snapshot, preserving spatial correlation while treating scenarios as mutually
      independent realizations.

      As a result, the number of scenarios $K$ directly corresponds to the number of
      time steps generated in the random field.
      Robust optimization with discrete uncertainty therefore evaluates candidate paths
      against all temporal realizations of the cost field considered in the experiment.

      For discrete uncertainty sets, the min--max problem can be reformulated using an
      epigraph formulation:

      \vspace{0.4cm}
      \begin{mdframed}[
        linewidth=0.8pt,
        roundcorner=5pt,
        innerleftmargin=10pt,
        innerrightmargin=10pt,
        innertopmargin=10pt,
        innerbottommargin=10pt
      ]
      \textbf{Epigraph Reformulation for Discrete Uncertainty}
      \begin{empheq}{align}
      \min \quad & z \\
      \text{s.t.}\quad
      & z \ge \sum_{i \in [n]} c_i^k x_i && \forall k \in [K], \\
      & x \in \mathcal{X}.
      \end{empheq}
      \end{mdframed}

      This reformulation replaces the inner maximization by a finite set of linear
      constraints and yields a deterministic mixed-integer optimization problem.




    \paragraph{Continuous Budgeted Uncertainty Sets}
      Continuous budgeted uncertainty sets aggregate information across multiple cost
      scenarios into a compact representation consisting of nominal costs and bounded
      deviations.
      Rather than treating each scenario independently, this model summarizes the
      range of cost variation observed across time.

      In this thesis, nominal and worst-case edge costs are derived by aggregating all
      scenario realizations of a given edge across time.
      For each directed edge, a nominal cost $\underline{c}_i$ and a maximum deviation
      $d_i$ are computed from the set of observed costs across scenarios.
      The resulting budgeted uncertainty set restricts the total amount of deviation
      that may occur simultaneously across edges by means of a global budget parameter
      $\Gamma$.
      \[
      \mathcal{U}
      =
      \left\{
      \mathbf{c} \;\middle|\;
      c_i = \underline{c}_i + d_i \delta_i,\;
      0 \le \delta_i \le 1,\;
      \sum_{i \in [n]} \delta_i \le \Gamma
      \right\}.
      \]
      In contrast to the discrete uncertainty set, the budgeted uncertainty set shown in Figure~\ref{fig:budgeted-uncertainty-set}
defines a continuous polyhedral region around a nominal cost vector, where the total
deviation across edges is limited by the budget parameter $\Gamma$.

      For shortest-path planning, the budget parameter $\Gamma$ admits an intuitive
      interpretation.
      It bounds the number or aggregate magnitude of edges along a path whose costs are
      allowed to deviate from their nominal values at the same time.
      Small values of $\Gamma$ correspond to mild uncertainty and yield solutions close
      to the nominal shortest path, while larger values model increasingly adverse and
      coordinated cost deviations, resulting in more conservative paths.

      Following standard duality arguments, the inner maximization problem can be
      dualized, yielding the following robust counterpart:

      \vspace{0.4cm}
      \begin{mdframed}[
        linewidth=0.8pt,
        roundcorner=5pt,
        innerleftmargin=10pt,
        innerrightmargin=10pt,
        innertopmargin=10pt,
        innerbottommargin=10pt
      ]
      \textbf{Robust Min--Max Formulation for Budgeted Uncertainty}
      \begin{empheq}{align}
      \min_{x,\,\pi,\,\boldsymbol{\rho}} \quad
      & \sum_{i \in [n]} \underline{c}_i x_i
        + \Gamma \pi
        + \sum_{i \in [n]} \rho_i \\
      \text{s.t.}\quad
      & \pi + \rho_i \ge d_i x_i && \forall i \in [n], \\
      & x \in \mathcal{X}, \\
      & \pi \ge 0,\quad \rho_i \ge 0 && \forall i \in [n].
      \end{empheq}
      \end{mdframed}

      In the experimental implementation, nominal costs and deviations for budgeted
      uncertainty are computed by aggregating all scenario realizations of each edge
      across time.
      Nominal costs are derived either as the minimum or the average observed cost per
      edge, while worst-case costs are given by the maximum observed value.
      The deviation parameter is then defined as the difference between worst-case and
      nominal cost.
      A detailed description of this aggregation procedure and its implementation is
      provided in the Methodology chapter.

      This formulation preserves the combinatorial structure of the shortest-path
      problem while incorporating controlled worst-case protection against uncertain
      edge costs.
      It constitutes the robust shortest-path model used for ex-ante planning in the
      experimental evaluation of this thesis.

    \paragraph{Summary}
      This section established the theoretical foundation for ex-ante shortest-path
      planning under uncertainty.
      Robust combinatorial optimization models uncertainty explicitly at planning time
      and yields solutions with worst-case performance guarantees.
      While discrete uncertainty enumerates extreme realizations explicitly, budgeted
      uncertainty replaces enumeration by a continuous envelope that bounds coordinated
      deviations across edges.
      In the following section, this approach is contrasted with search-based
      path-planning algorithms that address uncertainty ex post through adaptive
      replanning during execution.

\section{Incremental Search-Based Path-Planning}
\label{sec:incremental-search-based-path-planning}
    Incremental search-based path-planning algorithms constitute the canonical
    \emph{ex-post} response to uncertainty in shortest-path problems.
    Rather than committing to a fully specified path under assumed cost realizations,
    these methods maintain and update shortest-path information during execution as
    new cost information becomes available.

    This execution-centric perspective is particularly well suited to environments
    in which traversal costs are revealed incrementally or change over time.
    Instead of modeling uncertainty explicitly at planning time, incremental search
    algorithms treat uncertainty as an information process and adapt decisions as
    costs are observed.
    As a result, they emphasize responsiveness, reuse of prior computation, and
    real-time feasibility under partial observability.

    In contrast to robust combinatorial optimization, which selects a single path
    before execution and evaluates it against worst-case cost realizations,
    incremental search-based methods interleave planning and execution.
    Paths are repaired locally when costs change, allowing the planner to react
    to evolving conditions without recomputing solutions from scratch.
    This fundamental difference makes incremental search a natural ex-post
    counterpart to ex-ante robust optimization in the context of spatio-temporal
    cost uncertainty.


    \paragraph{Incremental Heuristic Search as an Execution Model}
      Building on the A* baseline introduced above, incremental search algorithms
      reuse heuristic search structure to enable efficient replanning under changing
      information.
      At their core, these methods maintain lower-bound estimates on remaining
      cost-to-go and exploit structural properties of shortest paths to reuse
      previous computation when costs are updated.

      For incremental search methods such as D*~Lite, a stronger and more general
      consistency condition is required.
      Rather than relating heuristic values across individual edges, D*~Lite employs
      a heuristic of the form $h(s_1,s_2)$ that estimates the cost of a shortest path
      between two arbitrary vertices.
      Koenig and Likhachev express the corresponding consistency requirement as a
      triangle inequality with respect to true shortest-path costs:
      \[
        h(s,s'') \le c^*(s,s') + h(s',s'') \quad \forall s,s',s'' \in V,
      \]
      where $c^*(s,s')$ denotes the optimal cost of a path from $s$ to $s'$.

      This formulation generalizes the classical edge-based consistency condition used
      by A* and directly supports D*~Lite’s backward search and moving-start execution
      model.
      In grid-based graphs, the condition is typically satisfied by metric distance
      heuristics such as Manhattan or Euclidean distance.

      Incremental heuristic search methods extend this framework by maintaining
      local consistency conditions between stored cost estimates and one-step
      lookahead values.
      Rather than discarding prior results when costs change, these methods repair
      only those parts of the search space that are affected by new information.
      Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*) formalizes this idea by introducing explicit
      consistency conditions that enable efficient reuse of previous search effort.


    \paragraph{D* Lite as a Canonical Incremental Planner}
      Dynamic A* (D*), originally introduced by Stentz, extends incremental search to
      navigation scenarios in which an agent moves through an initially unknown or
      changing environment.
      D* Lite preserves the execution model and optimality guarantees of D* while
      recasting its algorithmic structure within the simpler and more transparent
      framework of LPA*.

      Rather than introducing new planning concepts, D* Lite unifies heuristic search,
      incremental repair, and execution-time adaptation into a single coherent
      algorithm.
      It eliminates specialized state classifications in favor of a consistent
      incremental shortest-path formulation, significantly reducing implementation
      complexity while retaining theoretical guarantees.
      As a result, D* Lite has become the preferred incremental search algorithm in
      both theory and practice.

      In this thesis, D* Lite is used as the representative incremental search-based
      planner for the \emph{ex-post} planning paradigm.
      The following paragraphs describe its internal state representation, consistency
      mechanism, and execution model, which together enable efficient replanning under
      spatio-temporal cost uncertainty.

    \paragraph{State Representation and Local Consistency}
      Let $G=(S,E)$ be a directed graph with nonnegative edge costs.
      We consider a fixed goal $s_{\text{goal}}$ and a start vertex $s_{\text{start}}$ that changes as the agent moves.
      For each vertex $s \in V$, D* Lite maintains a cost-to-go estimate $g(s)$ and a
      one-step lookahead value
      \[
      \mathrm{rhs}(s) =
      \begin{cases}
      0, & \text{if } s = s_{\text{goal}}, \\
      \min_{s' \in \mathrm{Succ}(s)} \bigl(c(s,s') + g(s')\bigr), & \text{otherwise}.
      \end{cases}
      \]

      A vertex is \emph{locally consistent} if $g(s)=\mathrm{rhs}(s)$.
      Inconsistencies arise when edge costs change or when the agent moves, indicating
      that stored path information must be repaired.
      D* Lite restores optimality by incrementally re-establishing local consistency
      only where necessary.


    \paragraph{Priority Queue and Lexicographic Keys}
      All locally inconsistent vertices are stored in a priority queue.
      Each vertex is assigned a lexicographically ordered key
      \[
      k(s)= 
      \begin{bmatrix}
        k_1 \\
        k_2
      \end{bmatrix}
      =
      \begin{bmatrix}
      \min\{g(s),\mathrm{rhs}(s)\} + h(s_{\text{start}},s) + k_m \\
      \min\{g(s),\mathrm{rhs}(s)\}
      \end{bmatrix},
      \]
      where the second component acts as a tie-breaker.
      This key structure generalizes the $f$- and $g$-value ordering of A* while enabling
      incremental updates without loss of correctness.

        top node in $U$ at this point.}
        \label{fig:dstar-internals}
      \end{figure}


    \paragraph{Heuristic Shift and Moving Start}
      As the agent moves, the start vertex changes and heuristic values become outdated.
      D* Lite avoids reordering the entire priority queue by introducing a heuristic
      shift variable $k_m$, which accumulates heuristic differences between successive
      start positions.
      This mechanism preserves lower-bound properties while maintaining relative queue
      ordering, enabling efficient replanning during execution.


    \paragraph{Greedy Path Execution}
      Once all relevant vertices are locally consistent, the stored cost-to-go values
      define a greedy execution policy.
      The agent follows successors that minimize $c(s,s') + g(s')$, yielding an optimal
      path under the current cost realization.


    \paragraph{Role Within the Experimental Framework}
      In this thesis, D* Lite serves as a representative ex-post planning approach.
      It processes cost information sequentially and adapts paths during execution,
      but does not provide worst-case guarantees.
      This contrasts directly with the ex-ante robust optimization models, enabling a
      controlled comparison between adaptivity and worst-case protection under
      spatio-temporal uncertainty.
      We include further details regarding implementation and consistency to Koenig and
      Likhachev´s \cite{koenig2002} pseudocode in chapter 4.




\chapter{IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS}


    \section{Decision Support Systems}
    The experimental pipeline is implemented as a lightweight model- and data-driven DSS
    that orchestrates data generation, model execution, and result visualization. It
    provides a single control interface for running all experiments under identical
    parameter settings and producing comparable outputs
    (Figure~\ref{fig:topdown-architecture-DSS}). The DSS is implemented as a local
    Streamlit application; randomness is controlled through fixed seeds and explicit
    configuration parameters to ensure reproducibility.




    \section{Geostatistical Data Generation for Spatio-Temporal Cost Fields}
    \label{sec:geostatistical_formulation}


    This section links the implementation in the \texttt{STGRF} generator to the
    formulations in the appendix (Chapter~\ref{chap:appendix}). Each step below states the code
    action and its mathematical counterpart.

    \paragraph{Step 1: Covariance model and kernel selection.}
    A kernel from \texttt{GSTools} (e.g., Gaussian, Mat\'ern, Stable) (see Table~\ref{tab:gstools-covariance-models}) is selected and
    parameterized by variance $\sigma^2$, length scale $\ell$, anisotropy ratios $a_i$,
    and (if applicable) kernel-specific parameters $\nu$ or $\alpha$.
    In the implementation this corresponds to
    
    \texttt{Kernel(spatial\_dim=3, temporal=False, var=\dots, len\_scale=\dots, anis=\dots)}.

    This instantiates the covariance model $C(r)$ in \eqref{eq:covariance} with
    $\operatorname{cor}(\cdot)$ from \eqref{eq:correlation}.
    The anisotropy ratios define effective correlation lengths
    $\ell_i = \ell a_i$ and enter the metric distance in
    \eqref{eq:metric_xyz}, which in turn defines the spatio-temporal covariance in
    \eqref{eq:metric_spatiotemporal}. Time is treated as a third spatial dimension
    (spatial dimension $d=3$), consistent with
    $\mathbf{x}=(x,y,\tau)$.

    \paragraph{Step 2: Structured space--time grid.}
    The implementation constructs the coordinate arrays
    \[
    x = (0,\Delta,\dots,(N-1)\Delta), \quad
    y = (0,\Delta,\dots,(N-1)\Delta), \quad
    \tau = (0,\dots,|\mathcal{T}|-1),
    \]
    where $\Delta$ is the cell size and $N$ is the number of grid points per axis
    (\texttt{grid\_size} in the implementation). These arrays define the structured grid
    on which the field is evaluated, and each grid point corresponds to a coordinate
    vector $\mathbf{x}=(x,y,\tau)$ in the formulation of $Z(\mathbf{x})$.
    Let
    \[
    Z(\mathbf{x}), \quad \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d,
    \]
    denote a real-valued random field indexed over a $d$-dimensional domain.

    \paragraph{Step 3: Spectral random field generation.}
    Given the covariance model, \texttt{GSTools} constructs a stationary Gaussian random
    field via its spectral randomization method.
    The call \texttt{SRF(model, seed).structured([x, y, t])}, where \texttt{t} is the
    scenario index array $\tau$, produces samples $Z(\mathbf{x})$ on the structured
    grid, implementing the generation in
    \eqref{eq:srf_generation} for the covariance in \eqref{eq:metric_spatiotemporal}.

    \paragraph{Step 4: Global normalization.}
    To ensure nonnegative and comparable costs across scenarios, the sampled 3D field is
    optionally rescaled as
    \[
    \tilde{Z} = \frac{Z - \min Z}{\max Z - \min Z},
    \]
    where the extrema are taken over the entire space--time grid.

    \paragraph{Step 5: Scenario slices and graph mapping.}
    For each scenario index $\tau$, the 2D slice
    $f_{\tau}(x,y) := Z(x,y,\tau)$ is extracted as the spatial cost surface.
    The routing graph is a directed 4-connected grid; each grid point $(x,y)$ is mapped
    to a node id $i = xN + y$. Each directed edge $(i,j)$ receives the mean of its
    incident node values,
    \[
    c(i,j) = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(f_{\tau}(x_i,y_i) + f_{\tau}(x_j,y_j)\bigr),
    \]
    yielding a scenario-specific edge-cost graph derived directly from the realization
    $Z(\mathbf{x})$.
    We use \texttt{NetworkX} to generate our 4-connected graph.

    \paragraph{Step 6: Export for downstream models.}
    The implementation writes a global node file and one edge file per scenario, as well
    as the per-scenario field slices, enabling downstream shortest-path and robust
    optimization models to consume the same spatio-temporal realizations.



    \section{Discrete Uncertainty Min--Max Model}
      The sets $V$ and $E$ are instantiated from the data files ($V$ from \texttt{nodes.csv}, $E$ from \texttt{edges.csv} in scenario 000), and each scenario cost vector $\mathbf{c}^{\omega}$ is read from the corresponding \texttt{scenario\_$\omega$/edges.csv}.

      The solution represents a path that is feasible for all scenarios and optimal with
      respect to the worst-case cost realization.
      While this formulation provides strong robustness guarantees, its size grows
      linearly with the number of scenarios and can become computationally demanding.

\label{app:dstar_lite}
All theoretical properties and correctness guarantees of D*~Lite are discussed in
Chapter~2.

\paragraph{Modeling Differences.}
Compared to the reference formulation by Koenig and \\
Likhachev~\cite{koenig2002},
the following modeling assumptions are adopted:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a 4-connected grid graph instead of 8-connectivity,
  \item initial edge costs are given by the first STRF realization rather than
        uniform default values,
  \item edges are never blocked; unfavorable regions are modeled exclusively via
        increased traversal costs.
\end{itemize}
These choices ensure structural consistency with the robust optimization models
and isolate uncertainty effects to edge costs.

\paragraph{Scenario-Based Cost Evolution.}
The original D*~Lite algorithm assumes static edge costs that may be revealed
incrementally.
To model spatio-temporal cost uncertainty, the implementation is extended to
operate on a sequence of time-indexed cost maps derived from spatio-temporal
random field (STRF) realizations.

During execution, the agent advances greedily according to locally consistent
$g$-values.
After a fixed number of movement steps, the active scenario index is advanced.
Only those edges whose costs differ between consecutive scenarios are updated,
and the standard D*~Lite update rules are applied.
Local consistency is restored incrementally via \textit{ComputeShortestPath()},
thereby repairing the existing backward search rather than recomputing paths
from scratch.

\paragraph{Coupling Robust Planning and Incremental Execution.}
To investigate the interaction between ex-ante robustness and ex-post
adaptivity, D*~Lite can optionally be guided by a robust offline shortest path.
The robust path is reduced to a coarse sequence of intermediate waypoints,
referred to as \emph{beacons}, obtained by uniformly subsampling interior nodes.

Beacons act as temporary goals and are activated according to a
scenario-based schedule or once reached.
Whenever a new beacon becomes active, the D*~Lite search state is fully
reinitialized, deliberately discarding cross-goal reuse.
This design enforces a clear separation between global guidance and local
adaptation and serves as an experimental control mechanism rather than a new
planning algorithm.

\paragraph{Algorithmic Structure and Pseudocode Mapping.}
The implementation follows the original D*~Lite pseudocode by Koenig and
Likhachev~\cite{koenig2002}.
Core procedures are implemented without modification, while application-specific
extensions are inserted at well-defined points in the control flow.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Initialize()} (\{01--06\}): initializes all $g$-values and
        $\mathrm{rhs}$-values to infinity, sets the goal’s $\mathrm{rhs}$ to zero,
        and seeds the priority queue for backward search.
  \item \textbf{CalculateKey()} (\{12--13\}): computes the lexicographic priority
        key used to order vertices in the queue, incorporating the heuristic
        shift variable.
  \item \textbf{UpdateVertex()} (\{07--09\}): maintains queue consistency by
        inserting, updating, or removing vertices based on local consistency.
  \item \textbf{ComputeShortestPath()} (\{10--28\}): incrementally restores local
        consistency by propagating cost changes backward until the current start
        vertex is locally consistent.
  \item \textbf{Main()} (\{29--48\}): executes greedy forward motion, detects edge
        cost changes, applies updates, and triggers replanning as required.
\end{itemize}

The two application-specific extensions are embedded into the original control flow:
(i) \textit{ScenarioUpdate()}, which applies STRF-induced edge-cost changes
incrementally during execution, and
(ii) \textit{ActivateNextBeacon()}, which implements milestone-based goal
switching using robust offline paths.

Both extensions preserve the theoretical guarantees of D*~Lite within each
fixed-goal phase and are included solely to support controlled empirical
comparison under spatio-temporal uncertainty.



\chapter{EXPERIMENTAl RESULTS}
    In our experiments, global path planners are evaluated with respect to solution quality
    and computational effort. 

    For each configuration, results are aggregated over runs using identical seeds across algorithms.
    We report the median realized costs and median runtime. 
    Uncertainty is summarized via a non-paramteric bootstrap 95\% confidence interval of the median cost.
    Our CI is estimated by repeatedly resampling observed costs with replacement 1,000 times.
    Each resample is the same size as the original sample and we compute the median for each resample.
    We then take the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of those 1,000 medians as the 95\% CI.

    This combination provides a statistically sound and interpretable summary of algorithmic
    performance under stochastic spatio-temporal uncertainty.

    Two-layer experiments:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item layer: run extremes to find out which parameters yield the most promising comparison results
      \item layer: re-run promising parameters in greater variability 
    \end{itemize}

      \paragraph{Research Questions}
    To achieve the stated research objective, this thesis addresses the following research
    questions through experimental evaluation:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item[RQ1:] How do ex-ante robust optimization and ex-post adaptive search-based planning
      methods compare in terms of path quality and realized traversal cost under identical
      spatio-temporal cost uncertainty?

      \item[RQ2:] What are the computational trade-offs between robust optimization models and
      incremental search methods when applied to shortest-path planning under uncertainty?

      \item[RQ3:] How does execution-time adaptivity influence the performance of planning
      approaches in environments with dynamically evolving traversal costs?

      \item[RQ4:] Can a hybrid planning approach that combines robust ex-ante guidance with
      incremental ex-post replanning improve performance compared to using either paradigm
      in isolation?
    \end{itemize}

    Many real-world planning and routing decisions must be made under conditions
    of uncertainty and dynamic change. Traversal costs may depend on environmental
    factors such as weather conditions, terrain properties, or sensor noise and
    may vary over both space and time.

    This illustration shows how heterogeneous environmental sensor data can be
    spatially aggregated into a continuous cost field that serves as input for
    graph-based routing models.
\end{minipage}
\caption{Visualization of the baseline cost field for the first time frame.}
\end{figure}

    \paragraph{Length Scale}
          To ensure comparability across instance sizes, correlation lengths are defined relative to the extent
      of the modeled domain. Throughout all experiments, the spatial discretization is kept fixed, i.e.,
      the cell size satisfies $\Delta p = \Delta q = 1$, and correlation lengths are therefore expressed
      directly in grid units. Spatial correlation lengths are scaled proportionally with grid size according
      to
      \[
      \ell_p = \alpha N_p, \qquad \ell_q = \alpha N_q,
      \]
      where the scaling constant $\alpha$ is calibrated from a reference configuration. This construction
      keeps the ratio $\ell / N$ constant and thereby preserves the relative spatial smoothness of the
      generated cost fields across grid resolutions.

      Temporal correlation is defined relative to the scenario horizon $|\mathcal{T}|$ (with fixed time step). When
      $|\mathcal{T}|$ is fixed (e.g., $|\mathcal{T}| = 10$), the temporal correlation length $\ell_t$ is kept constant; if $|\mathcal{T}|$
      changes, we set
      \[
      \ell_t = \beta |\mathcal{T}|,
      \]
      with $\beta$ calibrated analogously, so that the ratio $\ell_t / |\mathcal{T}|$ remains constant.

      The scaling constants are calibrated from the baseline configuration, yielding
      $\alpha = \ell_p^0 / N_p^0 = \ell_q^0 / N_q^0 = 0.25$ and
      $\beta = \ell_t^0 / |\mathcal{T}|^0 = 0.3$.


      \paragraph{Uncertainty Budget}
      Since the budget parameter $\Gamma$ is continuous in our implementation, we
      parameterize robustness via a normalized factor $\lambda \in [0,1]$ and set
      \[
      \Gamma(\lambda) = \lambda \Gamma_{\max}, 
      \qquad 
      \Gamma_{\max} := L_{\min} = (N_p-1) + (N_q-1),
      \]
      where $L_{\min}$ is the minimum number of edges on an $s$--$t$ path in the
      $4$-connected grid. Thus, $\lambda=0$ yields the nominal model, while
      $\lambda=1$ corresponds to full conservatism. We use $\lambda=0.1$ as the
      baseline robustness level.

  \section{Experiment 6: Number of Beacons}
    In this experiment, we study the effect of milestone-based replanning frequency by
    varying the number of beacons used during execution. Increasing the number of beacons
    corresponds to more frequent replanning opportunities along the path.

\chapter{CONCLUSION}
    Our experiments show that combining robust combinatorial optimization handling uncertainty via uncertainty sets can be used 
    for mobile robot path finding to a certain degree.

    One possible adaptation that we find worth looking into in future research is robust optimization for smaller scenarios/ windows.
    For example, imagine an evironment with environmental sensors placed on "hotspots".
    We could map sensor data as costs on an unstructured grid and use this real time data as possible waypoints for a coupled-D*Lite approach.
    A robust combinatorial optimization method could be used beforehand to make out the best possible route using these possible waypoints
    to give a rough estimate route for D* Lite to then traverse through.

Formulas including the subscript $(h < 1)$ are piecewise-defined functions being constantly zero for $h > 1$.
Here, $h$ is the non-dimensional distance, $d$ is the dimension,
$\Gamma(x)$ is the gamma function,
$K_\nu(x)$ is the modified Bessel function of the second kind,
$J_\nu(x)$ is the Bessel function of the first kind,
${}_2F_1(a,b,c,x)$ is the ordinary hypergeometric function, and
$E_\nu(x)$ is the exponential integral function (Abramowitz et al., 1972).
All other variables are shape parameters of the respective models.
